        <h1>Intended Audiences</h1>
        <p>There are 3 audiences that should be able to benefit from this web application.
        The first being myslef, this site will act as a place for me to document projects, keep an up-to-date resume and leave
        myself breadcrumbs and instructions for various tools and systems I have used.  The next group I hope will benefit
        from this site are recruiters and employers.  I hope the information presented throughout this application
        will make it easier to determine if I am a good fit for roles needing to be filled.  Lastly I
        hope this page ends up being useful for those who have run into similar problems I have and that my solutions
        can help them find theirs.</p>
