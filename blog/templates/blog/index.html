                <h3>... I took the road less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.</h3>
                <h5>Robert Frost</h5>
                <p><em>The Road Not Taken</em> is the only poem I ever remember the name of, and has been one of the only
                poems I have ever known very well.  I would like to think that I am a road less traveled kind of person.
                And because of that I am lucky to have experienced a lot of cool things that most of my peers have and
                probably will not have the chance or desire to.  I was able to play Rugby in highschool, attend and
                graduate from a highly rated military college, serve six years in the United States Marine Corps, work
                as a contractor in Afghanistan, backpack through New Zealand, Thailand and Nepal among countless other
                pretty fun adventures.</p>
                        
                <p>Some of the more notable stories I have earned the privilege to tell often remind me of that poem and
                of how lucky I have been to experience those kinds of things.  I learned how to fly helicopers in
                Afghanistan by Ukranians speaking broken english who usually spent their days stumbling along the broad line between
                too drunk and too hung-over.  Our co-pilot did not speak good enough english to navigate the hot gun ranges
                we were often flying through so I needed to take the right seat.  I had never worked in aviation before
                so on my off time I would sit in the control tower (HMMWV aka humvee) studying how to communicate
                properly in that context.  Since I was in the right seat anyway and I was never too sure what side of
                the line the pilot was on, I decided it was a good time to ask for them to teach me how to fly the MI-8
                MTV we were getting thrown around in all day and night.  After about 2 weeks I dragging the nose through
                the valleys around FOB Shank pretty comfortably.</p>
